# Big Data Management Synopses

This repository contains a collection of simple implementations of synopses:
- Exponential histograms
- Count-min sketches (TODO)
- Bloom filters (TODO) 
- Counter bloom filters (TODO)
- Flajolet-Martin sketches (TODO)

Notes:
- The implementations are not optimized for performance or usability, but for simplicity.
