This repository contains a collection of simple implementations of synopses:
- Exponential histograms
- Cuckoo filters
- Count-min sketches
- Count-min sketches with range queries
- Bloom filters 
- Counting bloom filters
- Flajolet-Martin sketches (TODO)

Notes:
- The implementations are not optimized for performance or usability, but for simplicity.
